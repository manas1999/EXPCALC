In today’s modern world what if we could simply write an equation with your hand on the graphical user interface on the screen and get the result of the arithmetic equation.Gone are those days where a user uses the stereotypical calculator on the computer in which the user uses the mouse clicking for typing even basic expressions.How cool it would be if you could simply write an equation on the screen and automatically get its output.


So here is our product  EXPCALC which is a handwritten calculator in which a user simply with his hand and his own handwritting writes on our graphical user interface and gets the result of his expression and also gets digit and operation of his expression displayed.


For professionals (students,engineers,professors.etc.) if there is no calculator available you can just scribble your equations on the screen and get the result of the expression,you need not worry about the neatness of the digits as our product is well trained to recognise  and handle all sort of handwritings.  


So our product could be used not only as a calculator but also could be used by elementary school children to learn digits as our product displays the digit written by the user. If the child writes a digit our system predicts the digit closest to the written digit if it is wrong the child learns how to write the digit properly and neatly.


So why being old fashioned  and using  the 90’s calculators when you can use our new AI driven handwritten calculator 



Cost estimate : We estimate that our product could cost around 2000 $.
